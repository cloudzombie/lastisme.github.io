          <hr class="bg-green" style="margin-bottom:10px;">

          <div>
            The countdown is an approximation of the lottery expiration. This is because under the hood the lottery duration is measured in number of blocks in the ethereum blockchain. This blocks are expected to be discovered with an average time but they can occur with variance. For example even if the average time between blocks is 14 seconds in the last 1000 blocks, the next block can be found in the next second or in a couple minutes. The countdown is therefore calculated as the remaining blocks to lottery expiration multplicated by the average block time. The greater the number of remaining blocks, the more accurate is the approximation, viceversa the approximation could be misleading cause the mentioned variance. Consider variance as a matter of luck :)

          <div>
            The block timestamp could be <a href="http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/413/can-a-contract-safely-rely-on-block-timestamp">manipulated</a> by miners, to avoid this possible manipulation we decided to refer to the number of blocks.

            Sure we have! Just share the link with <i>?r=&lt;your address&gt;</i> such as <i>http://lastis.me/?r=0xCA9dC3F33d0e1C3975300D1DcdF114B9e9c305e8</i> <br> The address is stored in the player's browser as a cookie. Then every time the player buy a ticket with a local client the house fee is shared 50% with the referrer. If the user pay the contract directly we can't share the fee with the referrer. You can also embed the lottery in your own site calling the <i>buyTicket</i> function of the contract with your own address, this way the site's owner get the referral fee for every bought ticket.

            They are the address of the server providing information for the lotteries. If you have a localhost provider running on port 8545, synced to the last block, it will be used. Otherwise it will be used an ethereum public node. The public node is used for your convenience but the best solution for privacy and speed is to use your own node.

          <div>
            The site is fully functional when downloaded locally. We suggest you to download a local copy. We are also working to publish it on ipfs but we have a problem when javascript code call public ethereum nodes which are not https, so it's not working right now.

          <hr class="bg-green" style="margin-bottom:10px;">

          <div>
            We reccomend to use 200k as gaslimit, however it usually requires much less. The first transaction starting a new cycle in the lottery is the more expensive, about 150k. Usually it requires around 50k.

If you are not confortable, unlocking the account is absolutely <strong>not mandatory</strong> and you can buy tickets by copy & pasting or qr-scanning the contract address from the lottery detail page to your wallet. Neither having a working client on localhost is mandatory, however it's reccomended because it's faster.

            The fee of the house is 1% actually. The first player restarting the lottery does not pay the house fee. The lottery owner could change the fee but no more than 2% will ever be possible as you can see from the contract code. All the rest amount, at least 98%, will partecipate to the jackpot, at least 90% to the same lottery, at most 8% could become jackpot of other "Last is me" lottery.
