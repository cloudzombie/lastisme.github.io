            "Last is me" is a lottery where the winner is the last player buying a ticket! Every square in the home page is a lottery with a duration and a ticket price as the title. <strong>If no one buy a ticket throughout the lottery duration, the last one that did it gets the jackpot!</strong> As easy as that!<br> In the square you can see also the Jackpot amount in dollars, an <a href="#howcountdown">approximate</a> countdown when the lottery expire, and the actual winner. The countdown is resetted if someone buy a ticket before the duration expires. The last winner is also updated accordingly.

            Every lottery is a smart contract written on the <a href="http://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> platform. Execution is granted by the network and the running program is verifiable and unchangeable. In the lottery detail page there is a link to a third party site (<a href="#launchgeth">example</a>) verifying the deployed code does exactly what we explain in this pages.

          <hr class="bg-green" style="margin-bottom:10px;">

          <div>
            The countdown is an approximation of the lottery expiration. This is because under the hood the lottery duration is measured in number of blocks in the ethereum blockchain. This blocks are expected to be discovered with an average time but they can occur with variance. For example even if the average time between blocks is 14 seconds in the last 1000 blocks, the next block can be found in the next second or in a couple minutes. The countdown is therefore calculated as the remaining blocks to lottery expiration multplicated by the average block time. The greater the number of remaining blocks, the more accurate is the approximation, viceversa the approximation could be misleading cause the mentioned variance. Consider variance as a matter of luck :)

            The block timestamp could be <a href="http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/413/can-a-contract-safely-rely-on-block-timestamp">manipulated</a> by miners, to avoid this possible manipulation we decided to refer to the number of blocks.

            Sure we have! Just share the link with <i>#&lt;your address&gt;</i> such as <i>http://lastis.me/#0xCA9dC3F33d0e1C3975300D1DcdF114B9e9c305e8</i> <br> The address is stored in the player's browser as a cookie. Then every time the player buy a ticket with a local client the house fee is shared 50% with the referrer. If the user pay the contract directly we can't share the fee with the referrer. You can also embed the lottery in your own site calling the <i>buyTicket</i> function of the contract with your own address, this way the site's owner get the referral fee for every bought ticket.

            They are the address of the server providing information for the lotteries. If you have a localhost provider running on port 8545, synced to the last block, it will be used. Otherwise it will be used an ethereum public node. The public node is used for your convenience but the best solution for privacy and speed is to use your own node.

          <div>
            We reccomend to use 200k as gaslimit, however it usually requires much less. The first transaction starting a new cycle in the lottery is the more expensive, about 150k. Usually it requires around 50k.

            The fee of the house is 1% actually. The first player restarting the lottery does not pay the house fee. The lottery owner could change the fee but no more than 2% will ever be possible as you can see from the contract code. All the rest amount, at least 98%, will partecipate to the jackpot, at least 90% to the same lottery, at most 8% could become jackpot of other "Last is me" lottery.
